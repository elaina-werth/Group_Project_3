# String Manipulator
Create a Python program that takes a user-inputted string and performs various string manipulations using loops, conditional statements, and functions.

Program Requirements:  (Note:  At any point I should be able to request any single function and see its return value!)

● 	Input Gathering:
○ 	Prompt the user to enter a string.
○ 	Ensure that the entered string is at least 5 characters long.
● 	String Reversal Function
○ 	Create a function that accepts a string as an argument and returns its reversed form.
● 	Character Counter
○ 	Create a function that accepts a string as an argument and returns two values; the number of vowels and the number of consonants in the string.  Character Counter and String Analysis should be written by different students. (hint: how can string analysis use character counter to complete its task?)
● 	Character Replacer
○ 	Create a function that replaces a specified character in the string with another character. Allow the user to choose the character to replace. Return the new string.
● 	String Analysis
○ 	Create a function that accepts a string as an argument and analyzes the string and returns:
○ 	If the string is a palindrome
■ 	What is a palindrome?
○ 	How many total letters in the word
○ 	How many vowels in the word
○ 	How many consonants in the word

NOTE: This function should return FOUR values!  If you can’t remember how to return multiple values from a function, review the topic in your practice programs or search in Google.

● 	Menu
○     Create a menu allowing the user to choose which operation to perform (input a string, reverse the string, count vowels, replace characters, analyze the string).
○     Use a loop to repeatedly prompt the user for operations until they choose to exit.
